Cadence is a library for modern GameMaker projects for scheduling execution of code. It presents a simple API that lets you run any function with a given frame delay and repeat duration.

## Setup

Integrating Cadence into your project is simple: just [download the latest release](https://github.com/daikon-games/cadence/releases), and then in GameMaker click on the **Tools** menu and select **Import Local Package**. Choose the `.yymps` file you downloaded, and import all assets.

Alternatively you can install Cadence from the [Game Maker Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/10846/cadence).

Absolutely no further configuration is required! Just start calling `run_in_frames`

## Usage

Cadence exposes the following function:

```
run_in_frames(routine, executionDelay, [steps])
```

Note that `run_in_frames` is not a method of an object but rather provided globally by the script file `scr_cadence`.

Simply call it with any function you wish to execute in the `routine` parameter. The other two parameters control the timing of the function execution.

`executionDelay` is the number of frames that Cadence will wait before executing `routine`.
```
run_in_frames(function() {
    show_debug_message("hello!")
}, 15);
```
The above code example will wait for 15 frames from the time of its execution, and then print `Hello` to the output console.

The other parameter, `steps`, is optional. If not provided it defaults to `1`.
```
run_in_frames(function() {
    show_debug_message("hello!")
}, 15, 10);
```
The above code example will wait for 15 frames from the time of its execution, and then print `Hello` once per frame for an additional 10 frames.
